## Introduction

As biomedical imaging scales up, it is making more and more use of remote storage, remote computing and remote visualization.
Classical file formatsâ€”which store array data contiguously in a single fileâ€”are limited at large scales as
1. They often do not store data at multiple resolutions;
2. They do not offer efficient parallel access to data chunks.
   
These limits are very clear when it comes to visualizing very large data volumes, which cannot be loaded in full in memory.
In this context, it is preferable to only load the data required to display the current view (either a large field-of-view
at low-resolution, or a small field-of-view at high resolution).

The zarr format was developed to bypass the limitations of single-file formats such as HDF5. 
The microscopy community is currently developping its own standard for cloud-friendly biomedical imaging data: OME-NGFF. 
It build on zarr and adds rules for storing multi-resolutions images and medical-specific metadata such as axis names 
and voxel sizes. However, the microscopy community has needs in terms of metadata and coordinate-space description 
that are relatively complex, as they need to conform to different organs, different acquisition systems, or different tissue 
processing pipelines. This has drastically slowed down the adoption of a coordinate transform standardâ€”the current version (0.5)
only handles canonical scales and offsetsâ€”and has also made the future coordinate transform standard much more complicated.

In contrast, the neuroimaging community has adopted and used a standard "world" coordinate frame for decades, where
```
+x = left      -> right
+y = posterior -> anterior
+z = inferior  -> superior
```
An affine transform is used to map from  the F-ordered voxel space (i, j, k) to world space (x, y, z). 
The neuroimaging community has also created a simple data exchange formatâ€”NIfTIâ€”that has been widely embraced and 
is the mandatory file format in standardization efforts such as BIDS. However, the lack of multiresolution/chunk 
support in NIfTI has lead BIDS to adopt OME-TIFF and OME-ZARR as standard format for its microscopy component.

The NIfTI-Zarr (`nii.zarr`) specification attempts to merge the best of both worlds, in the simplest possible way. 
Like NIfTI, it aims to make the implementation of I/O libraries as simple as possible, to maximize chances that it 
gets adopted by the community. Its guiding principles are
* __OME-NGFF compliant:__ any `nii.zarr` file should be a valid `ome.zarr` file.
* __OME-NGFF minimal:__ only implements the minimum set of metadata necessary to describe [multi-resolution] neuroimaging data
* __NIfTI-complicant:__ the binary nifti header should be stored in the [group-level] `.zattrs` object.
* __NIfTI-priority:__ if metadata conflict across the nifti header and OME attributes, the nifti metadata should take precendence.

The simplicity of these guiding principles should make the adoption of `nii.zarr` in cloud environments (almost) as straightforward 
as the adoption of compressed-NIfTI (`.nii.gz`).


## Main differences with NIfTI and/or OME-NGFF

* Following the OME-NGFF specifcation, dimensions are ordered as [T, C, Z, Y, X] (in C order)
  as opposed to [C, T, Z, Y, X].
* To conform with the NIfTI expectation, on load data should be returned as a [C, T, Z, Y, X] array
  (in C order; [X, Y, Z, T, C] in F order).

### NIfTI features that are not supported by NIfTI-Zarr

* Any file with has more than 5 dimensions

| `timedelta`  | ðŸ›‘ unsupported! | `"m8[{unit}]"` |
| `time`       | ðŸ›‘ unsupported! | `"M8[{unit}]"` |

In Zarr, the byte order **MUST** be specified by prepending one of `{"|", "<", ">"}` to the data type string.

## Format structure

### NIfTI header

The nifti header ([v1](https://nifti.nimh.nih.gov/pub/dist/src/niftilib/nifti1.h) or [v2](https://nifti.nimh.nih.gov/pub/dist/doc/nifti2.h)) 
should be encoded as a string using [base64](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base64) encoding and saved in the group-level `.zattrs` under 
the `"nifti"` key.

As a reminder, the nifti1 header has the following structure:

```C
